Instructions:
1. Register an account by navigating to the /register route
2. Login to the account by navigating to the /login route
3. You should see a welcome screen after logging in.

Some edge cases that I considered are that if you try going to any other invalid route, you'll see a 404 page. Also if you try to enter invalid login credentials,
you'll be met with a red error that invalid credentials were entered.
